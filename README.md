The Daily Koala
=============

This is a fun project that I used to better learn node.js, jade, express, and graphics magick. This project is deployed on heroku and can be found at:

<br><br>
The context of this project lies with our good friend, Koala. Our friend circle became borderline obsessed with the derpness of his face and began sending each other pictures of him circa 2009 with a tagline of a software engineer pick up line.
<br><br>
This node js app does this automatically by taking a random picture and a random pick up line and putting them together. Every time you refresh the page, a new combination is created randomly. Now, you even have the option of submitting a good one to Tumblr.
